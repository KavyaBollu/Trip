    <p>"Bungy" redirects here. For the person, see Bungy Watson. Not to be confused with reverse bungee.
        Bungee jumping off the Victoria Falls Bridge in Zambia/Zimbabwe Bungee jumping (/ˈbʌndʒi/), also spelled bungy
        jumping, is an activity that involves a person jumping from a great height while connected to a large elastic
        cord. The launching pad is usually erected on a tall structure such as a building or crane, a bridge across a
        deep ravine, or on a natural geographic feature such as a cliff. It is also possible to jump from a type of
        aircraft that has the ability to hover above the ground, such as a hot-air-balloon or helicopter. The thrill
        comes from the free-falling and the rebound.When the person jumps, the cord stretches and the jumper flies
        upwards again as the cord recoils, and continues to oscillate up and down until all the kinetic energy is
        dissipated.</p>

    <p>Early tethered jumping Land diving is a rite of passage for boys of the South Pacific island of Pentecost The
        land diving (Sa: Gol) of Pentecost Island in Vanuatu is an ancient ritual in which young men jump from tall
        wooden platforms with vines tied to their ankles as a test of their courage and passage into manhood. Unlike in
        modern bungee-jumping, land-divers intentionally hit the ground, but the vines absorb sufficient force to make
        the impact non-lethal.The land-diving ritual on Pentecost has been claimed as an inspiration by A. J. Hackett,
        prompting calls from the islanders' representatives for compensation for what they view as the unauthorised
        appropriation of their cultural property.</p>

    <p>A tower 1,200 metres (4,000 ft) high with a system to drop a "car" suspended by a cable of "best rubber" was
        proposed for the Chicago World Fair, 1892–1893. The car, seating two hundred people, would have been shoved
        from a platform on the tower and then would have bounced to a stop. The designer engineer suggested that for
        safety the ground below "be covered with eight feet of feather bedding". The proposal was declined by the Fair's
        organizers.</p>

    <p>The first modern bungee jumps were made on 1 April 1979 from the 76-metre (250 ft) Clifton Suspension Bridge in
        Bristol, England, by David Kirke and Simon Keeling,members of the Oxford University Dangerous Sports Club, and
        Geoff Tabin,a professional climber who tied the ropes for the jump.The students had come up with the idea after
        discussing the "vine jumping" ritual of Vanuatu.The jumpers were arrested shortly after, but continued with
        jumps in the US from the Golden Gate Bridge and the Royal Gorge Bridge. The last jump was sponsored by and
        televised on the American programme That's Incredible, spreading the concept worldwide. By 1982, Kirk and
        Keelling were jumping from mobile cranes and hot air balloons.</p>

    <p>Colorado climbers Mike Munger and Charlie Fowler may have bungee-jumped earlier in Eldorado Springs, CO in 1977.
        Both were cutting-edge alpinists, preparing for a trip to Monte Fitzroy in Patagonia by simulating long falls
        onto a springy, 46 metres (150 ft) nylon climbing rope. They scrambled up to a large tree at the top of the 210
        m (700 ft) wall, above a severely overhanging climb appropriately named "Diving Board", and tied one end of the
        rope into the tree. With a piece of flat seat belt webbing around his waist and some homemade leg loops, Mike
        tied into the other end of the rope and, after no small amount of trepidation, he jumped. He then ascended the
        rope mechanically to the tree and untied. Then Charlie tied in and jumped. The total fall was about 40 m (130
        ft).</p>
