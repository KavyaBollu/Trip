    <h1>Welcome to Trip.com</h1>

    <p>Welcome to Trip.com, your go-to destination for exciting travel adventures and unforgettable experiences. At Trip.com, we believe in the spirit of exploration and the thrill of discovering new places.</p>

    <p>'Zip-lines' may be designed for children's play and found on some adventure playgrounds.
        A zip-line, zip line, zip-wire, flying fox, or death slide
        is a pulley suspended on a cable, usually made of stainless steel, mounted on a slope. It is designed to enable
        cargo or a person propelled by gravity to travel from the top to the bottom of the inclined cable by holding on
        to, or being attached to, the freely moving pulley. It has been described as essentially a Tyrolean traverse
        that engages gravity to assist its speed of movement.Its use is not confined to adventure sport, recreation,
        or tourism, although modern-day usage tends to favor those meanings.</p>

    <p>History Ropeways or aerial cables have been used as a method of transport in some mountainous countries for more
        than 2,000 years, possibly starting in China, India and Japan as early as 250 BC,remaining in use in some
        remote areas in China such as Nujiang (Salween) valley in Yunnan as late as 2015 before being replaced by
        bridges.Not all of these structures were assisted by gravity, so not all fitted the definition of the
        zip-line.</p>

    <p>Various technological advances in Europe in the Middle Ages improved the power-line's ropeways, some of which
        were still assisted by gravity.</p>

    <p>The first recorded use of the zip-line as a form of entertainment was possibly in 1739, when Robert Cadman, a
        steeplejack and rope slider, died when descending from Shrewsbury's St Mary's Church when his rope snapped. In
        literature, one appears in The Invisible Man(published 1897) by H. G. Wells as part of a Whit Monday fair
        and referred to as "an inclined strong".</p>

    <p>Some sources attribute the development of zip-lines used today as a vacation activity to the Tyrolean traverses
        developed for mountaineering purposes.</p>

    <p>In the Australian outback, zip-lines were sometimes used for delivering necessities to people working in or on
        the other side of a valley, and they may have been used in conflicts by Australian troops to deliver food, mail
        and even ammunition to forward positions.</p>
